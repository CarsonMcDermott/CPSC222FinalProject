Hypothesis: The shortest songs will belong to pop. The shortest songs fall at or below 
the 15.9th percentile, which is one standard deviation below the mean. Thus, the length 
of a pop song will be less than or equal to __ in milliseconds. 
    Note: This is a left tailed test!

Identify the null (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1):
H0: Length(pop) >= 164307.56942524196 ms
H1: Length(pop) < 96062.24866517205 ms
