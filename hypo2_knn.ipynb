    "Predictions:\n",
    "- depending on pop, both of our top genres, we think that the songs will be shorter\n",
    "- theres research that shows that pop songs and radio hits have to be shorter to catch people's attention\n",
    "    - article here: https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/billboard-100-shorter-explicit-2054269\n",
    "- we think the shortest songs will belong to = pop\n",
    "- we think that the longest songs will belong to = country\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "The shortest songs will belong to pop. The shortest songs fall at or below the 15.9th percentile, which is one standard deviation below the mean. Thus, the length of a pop song will be less than or equal to ______ in milliseconds. \n",
