    "Predictions:\n",
    "- depending on pop, both of our top genres, we think that the songs will be shorter\n",
    "- theres research that shows that pop songs and radio hits have to be shorter to catch people's attention\n",

    "Hypothesis:\n",
    "The shortest songs will belong to pop. The shortest songs fall at or below the 15.9th percentile, which is one standard deviation below the mean. Thus, the length of a pop song will be less than or equal to ______ in milliseconds. \n",
