    "1. take in the length of the milliseconds songs from our date\n",
    "    the data that is taken in from here is the ENTIRE MERGED SET OF C & J DATA\n",
    "    about 20,000 songs\n",
    "2. will say what artist the songs is most likely to correspond to \n",
    "    artists that it will predict are the 30 artists only from both of our data sets (aka J's top 15 and C's top 15)\n",
    "3. will say what genre that length of song is most likely to be in\n",
    "4. distribution of class labels is that about 50% is pop, 50% other genres\n",
    "Note: song genre from: https://getgenre.com/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is the length of the song + predicted artist cool to predict!\n",
    "Rember that both Carson and Jaylene had their top genre being pop, however before analyzing the data, we both felt that we don't listen to pop the most. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, our top songs were not in pop. For example, we had top songs from mostly indie (mirrorball) and rap (good life) genres. Our top songs are acutally both 3:30 minutes long! "

However, by the different standard deviations away from the mean, only one of the genres is predicted to be pop, and this is the second standard dev. away from the mean at 16000 milliseconds. "

    "After looking at this data, although close, we don't believe this representation is completely accurate. Beforehand and after reading the article about how there are more short, hit-pop songs nowadays, we would presume that pop songs would be shorter. However, using our hypothesis testing, we come to the conlcusion that we must reject our H0, as the average length of pop songs actually turned out to be longer than everything else in our domain set!"
